# ai-agents
Codebank for AI Agents 
## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various AI agents designed to perform diverse tasks. Each agent is built with unique capabilities and frameworks to showcase the potential of AI in different domains.

## Current Implementations
### 1. Crew AI
Crew AI is an agent designed to coordinate and manage tasks efficiently within a team. It leverages advanced algorithms to optimize workflows and ensure seamless collaboration.

### 2. LangChain Agent
The LangChain Agent is built using the LangChain framework, enabling it to perform complex reasoning and decision-making tasks by chaining together multiple language models and tools.

## Future Plans
We aim to expand this repository with more AI agents, each tailored to solve specific problems or demonstrate innovative AI techniques.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rarenicks/ai-agents.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ai-agents
    ```

3. Explore the agents:
    - [Basic Crew AI Tutorial](basic-crew-ai-agent-tutorial):  Implementation and setup instructions for the basic Content Writer Agent using Crew AI.

    - [Basic LangChain Tutorial](basic-langchain-agent-tutorial):  Implementation and setup instructions for the basic Content Writer Agent using LangChain.

4. Follow the instructions in each agent's folder to set up and run the implementations.
